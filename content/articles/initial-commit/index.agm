# Initial Commit

Hello there! I see you've stumbled across my technical blog (I mean it's technically a blog, right?). Hopefully I'll be posting some interesting stuff here on the odd occasion that will be worth your while.

I've also transferred most of the actual articles from my old site, which is now archived [here](https://github.com/kaadmy/kaadmy.github.io-archive/) for posterity.
